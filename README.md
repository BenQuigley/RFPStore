This Python script creates static web pages for the purpose of 
displaying question and answer text in a sectioned format.

The HTML output uses Bootstrap. It is adapted from the  [simple-sidebar](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-simple-sidebar) template by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com). You can see 
a sample [here](https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-simple-sidebar/).
